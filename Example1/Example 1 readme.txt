This Verba script attempts to maintain the alphabetic-only syntax while providing functionality similar to the ChucK script. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

We import audio and time modules.
We create a SineOscillator object.
We connect the oscillator to the audio output.
We set the frequency to 440 Hz (A4 note).
We set the gain (volume) to 0.5.
We define the duration as 2 seconds.
We output a message describing what's happening.
We use a sleep function to let the sound play for the specified duration.
Finally, we disconnect the oscillator from the audio output.

This example introduces a few new concepts for Verba:

"connect to" and "disconnect from" for audio routing
"dot set frequency takes" and "dot set gain takes" for setting oscillator properties
"time dot sleep for seconds takes" for creating a delay

These constructs aim to be descriptive and speakable while providing the necessary functionality for audio programming.
Remember, this is just one possible interpretation. As I  develop Verba further, I might find other ways to express these concepts that better fit your vision for the language.
