Let's break down this Verba script:

We import the necessary modules: 'io' for terminal output and 'tts' for text-to-speech functionality.
In the main function, we first output "hello terminal!" to the terminal using the familiar output syntax.
We create a new TtsVoice object named 'marvin' and set its voice name to "marvin".
We define the message that Marvin will speak.
We output a message to the terminal indicating that Marvin is about to speak.
We use the 'speak' method of the TtsVoice object to make Marvin say "hello world".
We add a sleep for 2 seconds to allow time for the speech to complete before the program ends.

This script introduces a few new concepts for Verba:

TTS functionality with a 'TtsVoice' object
'set voice name takes' for configuring the TTS voice
'speak takes' for initiating speech output

The script maintains the alphabetic-only syntax while providing clear instructions for both terminal output and text-to-speech output. It's designed to be readable and potentially speakable, in line with Verba's goals.
As always, this is one possible interpretation, and I may want to adjust or expand on these ideas as I continue to develop Verba.
